## Introduction

The SGE accounting file holds information on all submitted and _finished_ jobs submitted to the SGE scheduler.  Queued or currently running jobs are _not_ included in this file.  A job is considered "finished" if it completed successfully, terminated due to an error, or was cancelled.  The file is a colon-delimited text file with one job entry per row, with the most recently finished job appended at end.  Contrary to what one might expect, the file is not _perfectly_ ordered by the `end_time` of the jobs.  We might find some entries where the `end_time` of two consequentive entries might differ by a few seconds in the "wrong" order.  It's not clear to me why this is but it might be that the scheduler updates the SGE accounting file at regular intervals, say every few minutes, and when it does it goes through the jobs in order of job index.


## Indexing the SGE accounting file

In March 2020, the Wynton HPC accounting file was ~12 GB and took 6-8 minutes to read.  In June 2021, it was ~58 GB and had 161 million job entries.  In October 2021, it was ~69 GB and had 192 million job entries. It is rare to be interested in all entries.  It is more common to work with a subset of the job entries.  In order to do this efficiently, we start by indexing the SGE accounting file to identify the file byte offset for each job entry;

```r
library(wyntonquery)
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE) ## Report on progress
handlers(handler_progress(
  ":spin :current/:total (:message) [:bar] :percent in :elapsed ETA: :eta"
))

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
cat(sprintf("File size: %.3g GB\n", file.size(pathname)/1000^3))
# File size: 69.3 GB

## It takes ~15 minutes to index a 69 GB SGE accounting file
index <- make_file_index(pathname, skip = 4L)
cat(sprintf("Number of job entries: %d\n", length(index)))
# Number of job entries: 191745505

## Save per-job index to file
save_file_index(index, file = "accounting.index_by_row")
```

Next, we want to group the job entries by the ISO-6801 week of the job end times.

```r
library(wyntonquery)
library(progressr)
handlers(global = TRUE) ## Report on progress
handlers(handler_progress(
  ":spin :current/:total (:message) [:bar] :percent in :elapsed ETA: :eta"
))

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
index <- read_file_index("accounting.index_by_row")
cat(sprintf("Number of job entries: %d\n", length(index)))
# Number of job entries: 191745505

## It takes ~15 minutes to build the week index for 192 million entries
week_index <- sge_make_week_index(pathname, index = index)
saveRDS(week_index, file = "accounting.index_by_week.rds")

print(week_index)
# A tibble: 218 × 3
   week    nbr_of_jobs file_offset
   <chr>         <dbl>       <dbl>

10 2017W42          18      177695
# … with 208 more rows
```



## Reading job entries in SGE accounting file

Here is an example how we can read the job entries for a couple of weeks:

```r
library(wyntonquery)
library(dplyr)

pathname <- sge_accounting_file()
week_index <- readRDS("accounting.index_by_week.rds")

weeks <- subset(week_index, week %in% c("2020W06", "2020W07"))
print(weeks)
# A tibble: 2 × 3
  week    nbr_of_jobs file_offset
  <chr>         <dbl>       <dbl>
1 2020W06      627479 11015936052
2 2020W07      663484 11229385140

offset <- weeks$file_offset[1]
n_max <- sum(weeks$nbr_of_jobs)
cat(sprintf("Number of job entries to read: %d\n", n_max))

## It takes ~5 seconds to read the ~1.3 million job entries of interest
jobs <- read_sge_accounting(pathname, offset = offset, n_max = n_max)
jobs <- anonymize(jobs)
print(select(jobs, -account))

## Statistics on these jobs


```r
period <- range(jobs$end_time, na.rm=TRUE)
cat(sprintf("Period: %s/%s\n", period[1], period[2]))
# Period: 2020-02-03 00:00:01/2020-02-16 23:59:58

jobs <- add_weeks(jobs)
period <- range(jobs$end_time_week, na.rm=TRUE)
cat(sprintf("Period (weeks): %s/%s\n", period[1], period[2]))
# Period (weeks): Period: 2020W06/2020W07

cat(sprintf("Number of jobs finished during this period: %d\n", nrow(jobs)))
# Number of jobs finished during this period: 1290963

nusers <- length(unique(jobs$owner))
cat(sprintf("Number of unique users: %d\n", nusers))
# Number of unique users: 146
```

Let's see how many of the jobs finished succesfully and how many failed.

```r
## Get successful and failed jobs
groups <- list(
  success = subset(jobs, failed == 0L),
  fail    = subset(jobs, failed > 0L)
)
stats <- sapply(groups, nrow)
print(stats)
success    fail 
1227507   63456

print(stats/sum(stats))
 success     fail 
0.950846 0.049154
```

We see that failure rate among the ~1.3 million jobs that ran during this period was ~5%.  Next, let's see how much CPU time this corresponds to:

```r
## CPU time consumed
cpu <- sapply(groups, function(jobs) { d <- sum(jobs$cpu); units(d) <- "days"; d })
cat(sprintf("Total CPU processing time: %.1f hours\n", sum(cpu)))
# Total CPU processing time: 53069.7 hours

print(cpu)
#  success     fail 
# 37291.05 15778.61

## CPU-time fractions
print(cpu / sum(cpu))
#  success      fail 
#0.7026811 0.2973189
```

From this, we find that during these two weeks, ~30% of the CPU time was consumed by jobs that failed.  Among the failed jobs, the failure code was distributed as:

```r
print(table(groups$fail$failed))
#    1     8    19    21    26    27    28    37   100 
#    8    26  2520     8  2762    15 15552  9907 32658
```

From `help("read_sge_accounting", package="wyntonquery")` for details on the parsed fields and their data types, these description of these codes are:

 *   1: failed early in execd
 *   8: failed in prolog
 *  19: shepherd didn't write reports correctly - probably program or machine crash
 *  21: qmaster asked about an unknown job (not in accounting?)
 *  26: failed opening stderr/stdout file
 *  27: failed finding specified shell
 *  28: failed changing to start directory
 *  37: ran but killed because it exceeded the maximum run time (`h_rt`), maximum CPU time (`h_cpu`), or maximum virtual memory (`h_vmem`)
 * 100: ran, but killed by a signal (perhaps due to exceeding resources), task died, shepherd died (e.g. node crash), etc.


The jobs that exhausted their limits, consumed 9613 days of CPU time;

```r
d <- sum(subset(groups$fail, failed == 37)$cpu); units(d) <- "days"
print(d)
# Time difference of 9613.036 days
```

which corresponds to ~18% of all CPU time spent:

```r
> as.numeric(d/sum(cpu))
[1] 0.1811399
```
