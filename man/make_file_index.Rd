\usage{
make_file_index(
  pathname,
  offset = 0,
  skip = 0L,
  n_max = Inf,
  newline = "\\n",
  drop_eof = TRUE,
  bfr_size = 1e+07
)

save_file_index(index, file)

read_file_index(file)
}
\arguments{
\item{pathname}{(character) The file to be indexed.}

\item{offset}{(numeric) The number of bytes to skip before start indexing.}

\item{skip}{(numeric) The number of \code{newline} matches to ignore before
recording them.}

\item{n_max}{(numeric) The maximum number of bytes to scan.}

\item{newline}{(character) The character to scan for.}

\item{drop_eof}{(logical) If TRUE, the last identified byte offset is
dropped if at the very end of the file, i.e. when there is nothing
available to read from that position.}

\item{bfr_size}{(numeric) The number of bytes to read in each iteration.}

\item{index}{(numeric vector) A sorted index of file byte positions.}

\item{file}{A pathname to a \file{*.index} file to be
created or read from.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of file byte offsets that corresponds to the
beginning of a line, i.e. a position in the file that was preceeded
by a \code{newline} character.  The first line is at file byte offset
\code{0}, which is also always the first element in the returned vector.

\examples{
pathname <- system.file("exdata", "accounting", package = "wyntonquery")
index <- read_file_index(sprintf("\%s.index", pathname))
cat(sprintf("Number of jobs: \%d\n", length(index)))

## Get all jobs *after* the 500:th job
jobs <- read_sge_accounting(pathname, offset = index[501])
print(jobs)

## Get jobs 301 to 350
jobs <- read_sge_accounting(pathname, offset = index[301], n_max = 50)
print(jobs)
