Version: 0.0.0-9001 [2019-06-06]

SIGNIFICIANT CHANGES:

 * The system("scripts", "system_info.R", package="wyntonquery") script is
   now robust against errors; if there's an error querying a particular host,
   then that host is dropped from the final out.

 * The system("scripts", "system_info.R", package="wyntonquery") script now
   caches results from individual compute nodes.

 * host_info() now reports on 'cpu_model', which corresponds to the cpu_info()
   field 'model_name', e.g. "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8650U CPU @ 1.90GHz".
   Previously, it tried to report on the CPU speed but that fluctuated from
   run to run because it was incorrectly inferred from the 'cpu_mhz' field.

NEW FEATURES:

 * on_hostname() gained argument 'cache' for controlling whether cached results
   should be considered or not.
   
 * It's now possible to specify which hosts to query via environment variable
   'R_WYNTONQUERY_INCLUDE'.

 * on_hostname() gained argument 'on_error' for controlling how errors should
   be handled.
 
BUG FIXES:

 * cpu_info() did not handle upper-case letters in field names.
