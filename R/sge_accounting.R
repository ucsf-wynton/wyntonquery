#' Read an SGE accounting
#'
#' @param file (character) The SGE \file{accounting} file to read.
#'
#' @param \ldots Additional arguments passed to [read_raw_sge_accounting()].
#'
#' @return A `tibble` data frame with columns:
#'
#'  * `qname` (character) - name of the cluster queue in which the job has run
#'
#'  * `hostname` (character) - name of the execution host
#'
#'  * `group` (character) - the effective group id of the job owner when
#'    executing the job
#'
#'  * `owner` (character) - owner of the Grid Engine job
#'
#'  * `job_name` (character) - job name
#'
#'  * `job_number` (integer) - job identifier
#'
#'  * `account` (character) - an account string as specified by the `qsub` or `qalter`
#'
#'  * `priority` (integer) - priority value assigned to the job
#'
#'  * `submission_time` (dttm) - submission time
#'
#'  * `start_time` (dttm) - start time
#'
#'  * `end_time` (dttm) - end time
#'
#'  * `failed` (integer) - indicates the problem which occurred in case a job
#'    failed (at the system level, as opposed to the job script or binary having
#'    non-zero exit status).  Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job
#'    could not be started on the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the 
#'    job did not have a valid account on that machine). If Sun Grid Engine
#'    tries to start a job multiple times, this may lead to multiple entries in
#'    the accounting file corresponding to the same job ID
#'
#'  * `exit_status` (integer) - exit status of the job script (or Grid
#'    Engine-specific status in case of certain error conditions).
#'    The exit status is determined by following the normal shell conventions.
#'    If the command terminates normally the value of the command is its exit
#'    status. However, in the case that the command exits abnormally, a value
#'    of 0200 (octal), 128 (decimal) is added to the value of the command to
#'    make up the exit status.
#'    For example: If a job dies through signal 9 (`SIGKILL`) - probably issued
#'    by Grid Engine through `qdel`, or because the job exceeded time or memory
#'    hard limits - then the exit status is 128 + 9 = 137.
#'
#'  * `ru_wallclock` (drtn) - Difference between 'end_time' and 'start_time'
#'    (time interval), except that if the job fails, it is zero.
#'
#'  * `ru_utime` (drtn) - user CPU time (in seconds) used, i.e. total amount of
#'    time spent executing in user mode
#'
#'  * `ru_stime` (drtn) - system CPU time (in seconds) used, i.e. total amount
#'    of time spent executing in kernel mode
#'
#'  * `ru_maxrss` (character) - maximum resident set size (in kB)
#'
#'  * `ru_ixrss` (character) - integral shared memory size (in kB) \[UNUSED\]
#'
#'  * `ru_ismrss` (character) - ???

#'  * `ru_msgrcv` (numeric) - number of IPC messages received \[UNUSED\]
#'
#'  * `ru_nsignals` (numeric) - number of signals received
#'
#'  * `ru_nvcsw` (numeric) - number of voluntary context switches (number of
#'    times a context switch resulted due to a process voluntarily giving up
#'    the processor before its time slice was completed (usually to await
#'    availability of a resource)
#'
#'  * `ru_nivcsw` (numeric) - number of involuntary context switches (number of
#'    times a context switch resulted due to a higher priority process becoming
#'    runnable or because the current process exceeded its time slice)
#'
#'  * `project` (character) -
#'
#'  * `department` (character) -
#'
#'  * `granted_pe` (character) - the parallel environment which was selected
#'    for the job
#'
#'  * `slots` (integer) - the number of slots which were dispatched to the job
#'    by the scheduler
#'
#'  * `task_number` (integer) -
#'
